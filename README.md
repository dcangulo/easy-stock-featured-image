Automatically attach stock photos as featured image to your posts without featured image.

Stock photos are provided by **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)**.

## How does it work?
Checks if the post (any post type with thumbnail support, including pages) has already a featured image associated, if it doesn't have one, it will fetch a stock photo from Unsplash and upload it to your media library then attach it as featured image.

## Installation
1. In your WordPress admin menu, hover to **Plugins** and click **Add New**.
2. Enter **Easy Stock Featured Image** in the searchbox.
3. Find the plugin entitled **Easy Stock Featured Image** by **David Angulo** then click **Install Now**.
4. Click **Activate** once the plugin is installed.

## Installation using Composer
```
composer require wpackagist-plugin/easy-stock-featured-image

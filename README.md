Automatically attach stock photos as featured image to your posts without featured image.

Just install the plugin and the set your preference. No coding skills needed.

Stock photos are provided by **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)**.

## How does it work?
Checks if the post (any post type with thumbnail support, including pages) has already a featured image associated, if it doesn't have one, it will fetch a stock photo from Unsplash and upload it to your media library then attach it as featured image.

Please rate and review the plugin if you find it useful.
